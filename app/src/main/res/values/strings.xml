        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using Content here, content here, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for lorem ipsum will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

    <string name="about1">
        Many different forms of technology may be used to carry out cyberbullying. When cyberbullying is carried out through the use of mobile phones, it is known as mobile bullying. Kowalski et al. (2008) have defined mobile bullying as a form of cyberbullying through email, chatrooms, instant messaging and small text messages using mobile phones.
    </string>

    <string name="about2">
        Mobile victimisation is in turn is the result of mobile bullying. Victimisation has often been studied as an act that stems from bullying. Coincidentally, similar definitions have been given for both victimisation and bullying. Meaning that those people who are bullied are victims of bullying as they would have been victimised through the process of bullying. As a result, victimisation can be said to be a result of the activity of bullying.
    </string>

    <string name="about3">
        It has been found that the experience of school and electronic victimisation is associated with loneliness, peer rejection, lower self-esteem and self-efﬁcacy, higher stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms which at times are found to be at high levels among youthful populations.
Victimisation is often unpredictable, unpreventable and unexpected. It frightens and unsettles victims, leaving them confused, frustrated, fearful and angry. In some case, especially among adolescents, cyberbullying (in general) has left victims feeling helpless, vulnerable and subsequently suicidal. According to Hinduja and Patchin (2010), there exists a relationship between bullying and suicide and they found that cyberbullying is related to high suicidal ideation among youth. As a result, victims of cyberbullying are more likely to consider suicide due to the negative impacts of bullying (Collins, 2012; North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System, 2015).
    </string>

    <string name="about4">
Bearing in mind the negative consequences of mobile victimisation and the vast impact it has had on many students, the MVMR app aims to be a  digitally based tool that may be used as an intervention method. This app aims to be useful in the monitoring and reporting of mobile victimisation, especially among high school students. Thereby creating a means by which their victimisation may be known and addressed.
    </string>

    <string name="about5">
In monitoring and reporting mobile victimisation using the MVRM app, it is intended not only to intervene mobile victimisation but also to understand it further so that awareness of mobile victimisation is created and the development of laws and policies that control mobile bullying  and victimisation may be better informed.
    </string>

    <string name="howTo1">
